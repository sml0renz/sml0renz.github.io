### Below are the dates and short descriptions of my projects:

#### Winter, 2021: Introduction into Generalizability Theory: Working with Dr. Forsberg (Knox College) and Dr. Solomon (University at Albany, SUNY), I compared the Classical Test Theory to the Generalizability Theory (G-Theory). This used the R statistics program and, where I tested how packages in R were used, as well as developed important packages. This simplified the G-Theory calculations. 

#### Summer, 2021: Electoral Forensics: In this summer project, I worked among a group of statisticians and political scientists to statistically test for differential invalidation in Egypt's 2018 Presidential Election. This furthered my skills in R and statistics by using vector generalized linear models as well as in-depth geocomputation (created in R) of the invalidation rate in Governorates. From the model, we concluded unfairness in the 2018 election. A completed formal paper of our methods and conclusions was presented to a seminar held by Knox College.

#### Winter of 2022: Electoral Forensics: In this Winter project, I worked with Dr. Stewart (Knox College) and delved into political reasons behind differential invalidation. This furthered my R skills as well as allowed me to explore the reasons behind statistics. A formal paper was completed and the methods and results were presented to a seminar held by the Political Science Department at Knox College. 

#### Winter 2022 to Spring 2022: Wrote a solutions manual to Understanding Elections through Statistics: Polling, Prediction, and Testing for Dr. Forsberg (Knox College). This was a further development of my R skills. Furthermore, this allowed me to apply what I have learned about elections through statistics and further extend my writing skills. The interface LaTeX was used to present the mathematics in the solution manual without hassle. 

#### Summer 2022: A Study of Classification Models: In this project, I studied types of classification models in R and in Python. This allowed me to extend my skills in Python as well as statistics by studying how the models classified types of mushrooms as edible or poisonous. A formal paper was written, as well as a presentation through a seminar held by Knox College. 

#### Fall 2022 to Current: Honors project on Generalized and Vector Generalized Linear Models: This project has allowed me to apply my skills in R with many different data sets. I have read two upper-undergraduate texts on both types of model. A formal paper is in the review process, which contains what I have found, research I mathematically conducted, programs I have written to test these theories, and further applications to both types of modeling.
